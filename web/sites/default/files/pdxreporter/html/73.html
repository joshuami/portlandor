<!-- Abandoned Auto (73) -->

<p class="p">If you would like to have a quicker response to your reports of a vehicle that appears to be abandoned on the public right-of- way, report directly to the PBOT report form at: <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/71693" target="_blank">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/71693</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Reporting in PDXReporter will result in a slower response to your report, but if you do still want to report here, you MUST provide the following information in order for the City to investigate your report.</p>
<p class="p">REQUIRED INFORMATION:</p>
<ul class="ul">
	<li>Your name and daytime phone number*</li>
	<li>Address where the vehicle is parked</li>
	<li>Make, color and body style</li>
	<li>License plate number and state, if available</li>
	<li>Description of vehicle, i.e. missing wheels or parts</li>
</ul>

<p class="p">* If your <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/myaccount.cfm" target="_blank">user profile</a> already includes your daytime phone number, you do not need to provide it in your report.</p>
