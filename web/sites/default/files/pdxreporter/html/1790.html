<!-- Campsite Reporting (1790) -->
<p class="p">Campsite reports enable us to better understand where services are most needed. Reporting criteria: Repeated instances of overly aggressive behavior from campers (call <b class="tel">9-1-1</b> for emergencies); obstructing public right-of-way; misuse of public space; permanent structures; excessive trash or biohazards; damage to the environment; public intoxication or conspicuous drug use.</p>
<p class="p">Note: please use caution when taking photos. It is not necessary to take close-up photos of individuals in the camps. If you do choose to take photos of the campsite, general visuals of the location are the most useful.</p>
